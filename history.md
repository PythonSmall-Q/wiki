## Origion of Sean Proxies

It was in early January 2023 when I thought of building a proxy for everyone in the world. That thought first came around late 2022 when China's GFW became extraordinarily high. So I browsed in google and found the company Cloudflare. That company is great in web performance and offers a free DNS and CDN all around the world, including China!

## What is Cloudflare?

Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE: NET) is on a mission to help build a better Internet. Cloudflare is a global cloud services provider that delivers a broad range of services to businesses of all sizes and in all geographiesâ€”making them more secure, enhancing the performance of their business-critical applications, and eliminating the cost and complexity of managing individual network hardware.

So, I started to use and fell in love with this genious company.
